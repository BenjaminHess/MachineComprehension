1	It was a beautiful sunny and warm day	I was working outside in my garden	I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job , but I was enjoying the day	I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake	It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake	On this day , I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake	I got up from my garden and walked to the lake	I kept hearing this strange sound	It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice	I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time	The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to `` say '' to other lake birds	There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short	Then there is the `` where are you '' call which is long , slow and loud	But this sound was not like any I had ever heard	I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything	But , no luck	I still kept hearing this low talking sound	I had now totally given up weeding	Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun	But where was it coming from	I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing	Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats	There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water	I spotted them !	It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them	They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish	The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish	I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour	I felt very special that I got to see this	It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening	I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was working in the garden	I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was fishing	What was I doing on this day at the beginning of the story
