The pink moon felt so lonely	So , the pink moon called on the sun for help	The great sun was very busy high in the sky , for it was his job to shine over the sand land , and it was hard to get his attention	So the moon wiggled closer and closer to the sun every second	The second turned to hours as the pink moon inched toward his friend , slowly moving across the sky	Finally , the sun saw the moon and asked , `` Pink moon !	What are you doing here	Do n't you know the sky is my home during the day	Your time is coming soon enough	Look , I 'm falling now toward my bed on the end of the earth ... '' But the pink moon could not be stopped and kept moving toward the great sun	`` But great sun , I become so lonely during the day when your light is so bright the animals in the sand land ca n't see me	Please let me join your light during the day this once ! ''	By this time , the great sun and pink moon were only inches apart	The great sun said , `` Though by day you disappear , I always remember you are here	Come to me now	Stand in front of me , and show the sand land your shine ! ''	So the pink moon inched in front of the great sun	At first , covering part of the sun 's circle , then more , then ... a complete covering of the sun !	The pink moon was shining with the power and light of the sun !	All the lizards , cacti and every animal stood still in awe of the daytime pink moon !	But at that time , the sun slipped away , saying `` Farewell , pink moon	We have to do this again ! ''	And so , every few years , the sun and moon come together to show the pink moon 's is always with us , even in the day time	pink color was the moon	cacti color was the moon	What color was the moon

I eat it every morning , often with a tall glass of lemonade	I sat down at the table to eat , and looked out the window at the birds in my yard	Sometimes I see skunks outside , and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig	But today there were only a few flamingos	I opened up the book I was reading , `` All About Birds . ''	I had finished the chapter on pigeons , and was moving on to robins	While putting ketchup on my marshmallows , I felt something tickling my neck	I looked down , and there was a daddy long-legs , climbing up !	I had never seen one so close to my face	`` Er , what 's up ? ''	I asked	`` Not much , '' he said	`` I smelled the hot pickles , and wanted to have a taste .

And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast	Flamingos type of birds did I see in my yard	Pigeons type of birds did I see in my yard	What type of birds did I see in my yard
