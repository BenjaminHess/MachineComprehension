The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings	It passed the birds , it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds	When it was there , it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question	The cloud said okay , and sent the squirrel back to the ground	The squirrel fell and fell for a long time	Finally he landed on the seesaw , but the ox did n't move	`` Where were you ? ''	the ox asked , `` Just talking with a friend , '' answered the mouse	I was watching and listening to everything , so I stayed , waiting	Soon enough , a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far , far away	So , you see , thunder can move a seesaw	What was the second thing the squirrel passed	the buildings

0	1	One morning , I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast	I fixed my normal breakfast : hot pickles , marshmallows , and ketchup	First I heat up the pickles on the stove , then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup	Delicious !	I eat it every morning , often with a tall glass of lemonade	I sat down at the table to eat , and looked out the window at the birds in my yard	Sometimes I see skunks outside , and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig	But today there were only a few flamingos	I opened up the book I was reading , `` All About Birds .
