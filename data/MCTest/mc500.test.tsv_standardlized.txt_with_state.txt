0	1	There was once a frog who lived all the way in the North Pole	His name was Isaac	He worked at Santa 's factory , baking cakes with lots of frosting	He did n't like making cake much	In fact , Isaac 's dream was to work in the factory with the elves making toys	But since he was a frog , he was never allowed to build toys with the elves	One day , he got a smart idea	He would dress up as an elf and sneak into the factory , hoping no one would find out	So he got a hold of an elf costume and put it on	He put on the elf hat , the elf shirt , and the elf shoes	He really looked like an elf !	So one day , when the factory was opening for the morning , Isaac snuck in line with the rest of the elves and tried to get into the factory	Luckily , it worked , and no one found out !	Isaac was filled with joy as he had never seen the inside of the toy factory before	It was huge , and there were thousands of elves building toys for the children for next Christmas	He joined them in building , and for a long time , no one knew he was a frog	That is , until one elf , named Joe , saw that there was something weird about Isaac	He did n't look like the rest of the elves	So he kept his eye on Isaac , waiting to see what his secret was	One day , Isaac slipped , and his hat fell off	When this happened , Joe saw that he was a frog , and not an elf !	He told Isaac that he would tell Santa all about how he had snuck in	Isaac begged Joe not to tell	Joe wanted to know what was in it for him , so Isaac promised to bake him a cake with lots of frosting	Joe never told	Where did Isaac live	In Santa 's house	Isaac lived in In Santa 's house
