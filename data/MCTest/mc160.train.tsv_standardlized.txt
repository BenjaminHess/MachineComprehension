What is the child afraid of	butterflies
0	1	I used to be afraid of butterflies !	It is true !	Once , my mom took me to Seattle	There , we went to a special place	We went to the zoo !	I saw lots of animals at the zoo	I saw bears	I saw tigers	I saw apes	I saw monkeys	I saw snakes	I loved seeing all these animals	They made me happy	We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they did n't even scare me	In fact , I like bugs	But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place	You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you	My mom and brother were so excited to go in , but I was scared	I was n't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere	My mom said I would be okay	My brother said I would be okay	They said butterflies were nice and beautiful	They said they would not hurt me	So I went in the room	Guess what	I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door !	The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop	He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies	I said I was sorry , but I was scared	He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there !	I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies	Since then , they would tease me about being afraid	They would try and get me to not be afraid	Last year for my birthday , mom bought me a butterfly book	She bought one for my brother , too	I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother	It became really fun to do	Once , a butterfly landed on me and I laughed	I liked it	It tickled me	It did not hurt me	Now , I like butterflies !

1	1	A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves	He is cold	It is snowing where he lives	He lives in Argentina	It 's warm where she lives in Hawaii	She eats fresh fruit	Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her	It is nice , but she misses him	She remembers he is very pretty	She wondered if he would really love her always , because she is older	He did n't care	Eduardo was poor , so he could not visit her	Maybe a time machine would help ! !	She can give back her birthdays !	But she did n't want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident	Like last time	Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her	His name was Eh	He said , `` close your eyes !	Then remember the most happy you have ever felt !	Let go of any thing that feels like clouds	Imagine puppies hugging you , and kitties purring with you	Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream !	As long as you remember how to be happy you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo !	And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again ! ''	It worked !

0	2	John thought about things that he liked to do	Well , for one , he liked baseball	Compared to his friends , he was very good at the sport	He did n't even have to practice that much	He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park	Home run !	He was also a fan of basketball	He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking ( but he did n't really like all of the passes )	He was n't quite that good yet , but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line	He knew that if he kept practicing , he would be really great someday	Finally , he loved football	Unlike baseball and basketball , he did n't play football himself , but he was drawn to the games	He got a kick out of sitting in the stands , cheering on his team and friends	He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day	What kind of things does John like	Video Games
