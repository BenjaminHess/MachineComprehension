The squirrel flew so high that it passed the buildings	It passed the birds , it passed the planes and stopped in the clouds	When it was there , it made friends with the clouds and asked one of the clouds a secret question	The cloud said okay , and sent the squirrel back to the ground	The squirrel fell and fell for a long time	Finally he landed on the seesaw , but the ox did n't move	`` Where were you ? ''	the ox asked , `` Just talking with a friend , '' answered the mouse	I was watching and listening to everything , so I stayed , waiting	Soon enough , a loud CLAP of thunder came from the clouds and threw the ox off of the seesaw and far , far away	So , you see , thunder can move a seesaw	What was the second thing the squirrel passed	the birds	the buildings	the clouds	the planes

2	One morning , I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast	I fixed my normal breakfast : hot pickles , marshmallows , and ketchup	First I heat up the pickles on the stove , then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup	Delicious !	I eat it every morning , often with a tall glass of lemonade	I sat down at the table to eat , and looked out the window at the birds in my yard	Sometimes I see skunks outside , and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig	But today there were only a few flamingos	I opened up the book I was reading , `` All About Birds . ''	I had finished the chapter on pigeons , and was moving on to robins	While putting ketchup on my marshmallows , I felt something tickling my neck	I looked down , and there was a daddy long-legs , climbing up !	I had never seen one so close to my face	`` Er , what 's up ? ''	I asked	`` Not much , '' he said	`` I smelled the hot pickles , and wanted to have a taste . ''	`` Sure , little guy , '' I said	I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out	While I was doing that , that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm	He grabbed the rest of my pickle , and ran out the door !	And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast	What type of birds did I see in my yard	Flamingos	Pigeons	Pig birds	Robins

2	Nana had a bunch of money	She had saved money her whole life	But Nana was afraid of people stealing her money	She planned to hide it	First she moved it around in her house and hid it behind a wall	Then she put her money in the attic	But she still did n't feel safe about her money	She was sure someone would find it	Finally she took it outside and started digging in the ground	She buried it in the ground so no one would find it	`` It is going be safe here , '' said Nana	She was very pleased that she had hidden her money so well	The next day after breakfast , she went outside to make sure her money was still there	She stopped at the spot she thought she had buried it and began digging	After some time she had n't found it	She climbed out of the hole and looked around	She had used a tree as a way to mark the spot	But she could n't tell which tree	The wind was blowing and the trees all looked the same !	She had used a brown spot on the ground to mark the spot	But she could n't tell which brown spot it was !	She knew she was n't lost	Nana had hidden her money so well that no one could find it , and that included her !	How many different places does Nana hide the money BEFORE she hides it for the final time	Two	Four	Five	Three

1	`` I do n't think I can win the race '' Tim told his parents over breakfast	His mother asked `` Why not ? ''	but his father was silent	Tim knew his father did n't believe he could be a racer : only last year , he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son was n't a better runner	The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be , and maybe he did n't like to run	Tim , who had always preferred a good book to P.E	class , wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be , so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school 's Spring Fun Run	Tim answered , `` I 'm going to try to win , but Angela is so quick !	No one ever beats her at recess . ''	`` Well , we 'll be there for you , either way '' his mother said	Tim took an apple and walked to the bus	Since the race was after school today ( school was letting out at 3:00 today , instead of 3:15 ) , he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began	He did n't even bring his new book with him , an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be	3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin	All the other students had brought running shorts , but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants	Suddenly , he saw that his shoes were untied	As he bent down to tie them , one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee , making him fall down right as the race began	By the time he got up and tied his shoes , he saw he would finish in last place , as the other kids were much farther ahead of him	It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run	By the time Tim reached the finish line , the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small , as some kids had been finished for a long time	Tim 's father asked , `` What took you so long	I 'm surprised to see you here at all !	Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you would n't win ? ''	Tim thought about why he signed up	It was n't about winning the race , or making his father proud	It was about finishing , and showing himself that the doctor was right : he could be anything he wanted to be , like his favorite character , Simon	What does Tim bring to school	An apple	Nothing	A book	Shorts
