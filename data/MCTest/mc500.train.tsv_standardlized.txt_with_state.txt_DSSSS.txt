Oh how terrible !	My dad made the spider leave and right after that he saw an alligator come running up to him wanting a bite of his ice-cream too !	My dad dropped his cone , ran away , and bought a yoghurt instead	He thought about buying a dingdong , but since dinner time was so close and he had such a big lunch , he thought a yoghurt would be better	It 's a much safer and better dessert	165 words	Chocolate , vanilla , and strawberry such as in the cone	Strawberry , peach , blueberry such as in the cone	Vanilla , vanilla , chocolate such as in the cone	Chocolate , vanilla , blueberry such as in the cone

''	But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue	Suddenly , a car drove up	The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig	The tiny big was sad and mad	But then the people in the car got out	`` Look at how cute that little muddy pig is ! ''	said one	`` He 's so cute ! ''	said the other	`` Really ? ''	said the tiny pig	`` Yes ! ''	said his aunt	`` For the last time , everybody knows that pigs get muddy !

Jared always got chocolate , because that was Dad 's favorite flavor , too	Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather	Sally could n't choose	She really wanted mint chocolate chip , but they were all out	Finally she chose the shop 's special flavor `` Tropical Turtle ''	The family left with smiles on their faces , ready to have a great day at the beach	Sally not thought about doing Swim with dolphins	Sally not thought about doing Play Frisbee with her brother	Sally not thought about doing Splash in the water	Sally not thought about doing Build sand castles

1	Once upon a time , there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm	He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night	On cold winter days , he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn , getting some extra warmth	One winter day , the mouse was very cold , but needed something to eat	He left the hay stack , and ran past the lamp	He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse did n't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm	He ran and ran until he could n't any longer	The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside , so the mouse was all alone	He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred	Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor	The mouse waited until the farmer 's wife , Julie , came out the back door , and then the mouse ran into the kitchen	There were bread crumbs everywhere !	The mouse ate as many as he could before anyone found him	He heard the back door open again , and hid under the oven	It was warm there - there must have been a pie baking	Farmer Bill liked pies more than bread , cake , or cookies	The mouse stayed there to warm up , then ran back to the barn to sleep for the night	The farmer 's wife opened the back door	The mouse opened the back door	Fred opened the back door	The farmer opened the back door

If she had one wish , it would be that she was well enough to go outside and play	The storm last night had brought a lot of snow , she could see it through the window	The snow caused everything to twinkle and shine , like it was colored with a marker made of glitter	What a way to start Christmas break , with the flu making her stuck on the sofa under a blanket	Hannah 's brother was getting ready to go outside and enjoy the snow	He put on his jacket and put her hat on his head	He had to wiggle his gloves out of his pocket , but he was nice and warm	From the sofa , Hannah watched her brother play in the snow with his friends and throw snowballs	Her brother tossed a stone at the pond and it broke through the ice with a splash	The snow made everything twinkle	A marker made everything twinkle	A pond made everything twinkle	A blanket made everything twinkle

2	I had always had fun playing in the dirt growing up , digging , throwing , building , smashing , everything , so this year for my birthday my mom and dad had bought me a gardening kit to grow my own vegetables	It came with a watering pot , a shovel , a rake and seeds !	The next morning we all went out to the backyard to start our garden	We dug a bunch of small holes with my new shovel , put a seed or two in each hole , and covered them up with dirt and raked over them	Our dog was very confused because he 's the one that digs the holes	Every day I would get so excited to water them and see how big they 'd gotten	Every day they would get even bigger	That was the most exciting part !	Then they started making little tomatoes , and they sort of looked like grapes	And those too got bigger and bigger and started turning red	This was all very exciting and finally by Christmas my dad and I picked our fresh tomatoes and washed them to be eaten in a salad with dinner	he got the seeds for his birthday	he got the seeds for Christmas	he got the seeds for for eating his dinner	he got the seeds for Mother 's Day

It was finally my birthday and that meant I could start working at the nearby pet store	First off , let me say that my name is Lilly , and as I 'm sure you know , today 's my birthday !	Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl , so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties , puppies , lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me	Some people dream of being a doctor , or a nurse , or even a teacher , but I 've always wanted to work with pets	I 'll say , like many people , I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I wo n't get to take care of them !	I arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone	Her hair was covering her name tag so I could n't tell if her name was Martha , Margaret , or Mary , but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right	Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals , and I had so much fun the whole day	I fed them , gave them water , and even got to play with them !	Margie did n't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day	It was everything I ever hoped and I ca n't wait for tomorrow !	Work with pets has Lilly always wanted todo	Become a nurse has Lilly always wanted todo	Become a doctor has Lilly always wanted todo	Become a teacher has Lilly always wanted todo
